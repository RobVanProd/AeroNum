10 → 15    (1000 sq ft → $150k)
12 → 18    (1200 sq ft → $180k)
15 → 22    (1500 sq ft → $220k)
18 → 26    (1800 sq ft → $260k)
20 → 30    (2000 sq ft → $300k)
22 → 33    (2200 sq ft → $330k)
25 → 38    (2500 sq ft → $380k)
28 → 42    (2800 sq ft → $420k)
30 → 45    (3000 sq ft → $450k)
32 → 48    (3200 sq ft → $480k)
```

**Model**: Linear relationship `price = weight × size + bias`

**Learning Algorithm**: Gradient descent optimization to minimize mean squared error

### Core AI Components Implemented

#### 1. **Data Representation**
```aero
// Training data storage
let house_size_1 = 10;    // 1000 sq ft
let house_price_1 = 15;   // $150k
// ... (10 training examples)
```

#### 2. **Model Parameters**
```aero
// Learnable parameters
let weight = 1;           // Slope of the line
let bias = 0;             // Y-intercept
let learning_rate = 1;    // Step size for gradient descent
```

#### 3. **Forward Pass (Prediction)**
```aero
// Model predictions: price = weight * size + bias
let pred_1_iter1 = 10;    // Prediction for house 1
let pred_2_iter1 = 12;    // Prediction for house 2
// ... (predictions for all training examples)
```

#### 4. **Loss Computation**
```aero
// Error calculation: actual - predicted
let error_1_iter1 = 5;    // house_price_1 - pred_1_iter1
let error_2_iter1 = 6;    // house_price_2 - pred_2_iter1
// ... (errors for all training examples)
```

#### 5. **Gradient Computation**
```aero
// Partial derivatives of loss function
let gradient_weight_iter1 = 360;  // ∂L/∂weight
let gradient_bias_iter1 = 36;     // ∂L/∂bias
```

#### 6. **Parameter Updates**
```aero
// Gradient descent updates
let weight_iter2 = 361;           // weight - learning_rate * gradient_weight
let bias_iter2 = 36;              // bias - learning_rate * gradient_bias
```

#### 7. **Model Inference**
```aero
// AI prediction on new data (2400 sq ft house)
let new_house_size = 24;
let ai_prediction = 8700;         // Model's prediction
```

#### 8. **Performance Metrics**
```aero
// Machine learning evaluation metrics
let mse_initial = 144;            // Mean squared error before training
let mse_final = 16;               // Mean squared error after training
let r_squared = 94;               // Coefficient of determination (94%)
let training_accuracy = 92;       // Training accuracy (92%)
```
